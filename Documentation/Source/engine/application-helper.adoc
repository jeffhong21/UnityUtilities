## ApplicationHelper

PiRhoSoft.UtilityEngine.ApplicationHelper

### Static Properties

bool _IsPlaying_ _(read only)_::

True if the application is currently playing. This is different from the built in https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-isPlaying.html[Application.isPlaying] when the editor is transitioning to play mode but not yet playing. Application.isPlaying will return false in that scenario whereas this will return true. This distinction is relevant in https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.OnEnable.html[OnEnable^] for https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html[ScriptableObject^] derived classes.
