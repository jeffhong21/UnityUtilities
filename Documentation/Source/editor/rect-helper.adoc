## RectHelper

PiRhoSoft.UtilityEditor.RectHelper

### Description

RectHelper contains a set of static functions to help with layout and positioning of ui elements in custom editor controls. The functions work on the concept of taking pieces out of a larger https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rect.html[Rect^] rather than trying to build them manually.

### Static Fields

float _VerticalSpace_::

Initialized to the value of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUIUtility-standardVerticalSpacing.html[EditorGUIUtility.standardVerticalSpacing^].

float _HorizontalSpace_::

Initialized to the value of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUIUtility-standardVerticalSpacing.html[EditorGUIUtility.standardVerticalSpacing^].

float _IconWidth_::

Initialized to the value of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUIUtility-singleLineHeight.html[EditorGUIUtility.singleLineHeight^].

float _LineHeight_::

Initialized to the value of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUIUtility-singleLineHeight.html[EditorGUIUtility.singleLineHeight^] + _VerticalSpace_.

float _LeftMargin_::

Initialized to 14 which seems to match the value used by Unity in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html[Inspector].

float _RightMargin_::

Initialized to 4 which seems to match the value used by Unity in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html[Inspector].

### Static Properties

float _CurrentIndentWidth_ _(read only)_::

Returns the width of the current indent according to https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUI-indentLevel.html[EditorGUI.indentLevel^].

float _CurrentLabelWidth_ _(read only)_::

Returns the width to use for a label taking in to account _CurrentIndentWidth_. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorGUIUtility-labelWidth.html[EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth^] includes the indent whereas this does not.

float _CurrentFieldWidth_ _(read only)_::

Returns the width to use for a field without the portion reserved for the label.

float _CurrentViewWidth_ _(read only)_::

Returns the width of the view area inside the margins specified by _LeftMargin_, _RightMargin_, and _ContextMargin_ while taking scroll bars into account if they are visible.

float _CurrentContextWidth_ _(read only)_::

Returns the entire width of the view area while taking scroll bars into account if they are visible.

float _ContextMargin_::

Initialized to 0 and customizable to adjust margins for anything that uses _CurrentViewWidth_ to determine available area. <<editor/context-margin-scope.html>> can be used to modify this value and automatically reset it.
